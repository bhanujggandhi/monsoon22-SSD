The use of JavaScript Variables has some specific applications. The Library Management System is one of them. A certain user may be able to access some public variables. These variables may include user preferences for the kind of books they want to see, filters, or login information. Users can update the genre before every search. Certain public methods are capable of carrying out any useful action, including computations and modifying privileged variables. There are privileged variables that we want to display to the user but do not want any user to be able to access directly, such as the number of books left or issued for a specific subject or the number of subjects. Then there are Private variables that are utilized in business logic but are not particularly helpful to the end user include things like the number of books in the library. Then comes the static variables that we don't want to declare repeatedly, those reside in the heap memory. One example can be the amount of users accessed the website so far. We prefer to retain that variable incrementing as new users access the library site rather than reset it.
